# Projeto
  - Ruby on rails `Desafio Umanni`
  - Postgres
  - webpack
  - stimulus


# Start:


## Local
> First of all remember to run Bundle and Yarn to install all gems and frameworks

> Do not forget about the DB too (rails db:create db:migrate db:seed)

```sh
# run local machine
$ bundle install

$ npm install

# remember config database IN confi/database.ymal
$ rails db:create db:migrate db:seed

$ rails assets:precompile
```

# Using Docker




# Test using login user

> Some Logins already exist for use
- <b> Login-Admin </b> :axelpatton@gmail.com <br>
- Password: demo123 <br>
- <b> Login-User: </b> samuel_eto@umanni.com.br <br>
- Password: demo123 <br>

### How it works:

- Can register yourself like normal user

> User

- Can access your profile and see, edit or delete it

> Administrator
